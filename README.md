# Achievement-Watcher-Companion
 A simple Achievement Watcher Companion App to add Achievement manually

this is a simple App nothing is fancy about it, I think its full of bugs but it works so if you find any feel free to tell me ( it only works with English version of the app for now )

things you need to KNOW to make it work properly :

1/ Data Base File is this one :C:\Users\%your user name%\AppData\Roaming\Achievement Watcher\steam_cache\schema\english

2/ Game id is the game Steam id

3/ After creating the achievement folder make sure to launch Achievement Watcher App so it will recognize the game and create the .db file for it

4/ if the game was already on the Achievement Watcher App and Achievement were not unlocked make sure to delete older Achievement folder created by the game it self
